# Python

Both Software Tools & Advanced Analytics & Metaheuristics are my Graduate courses.

Software tools course deals with decision making(optimization) & In this project I have used python for "Facility location using P-median optimization".

Advanced Analytics & Metaheuristics course deals with prescriptive Analytics & using Artificial Intelligence algorithms for Decision Making & problem solving. The mathematical models developed are difficult to solve, so we need to use modern heuristic methods to solve problems. Some of the heuristic algorithms used are Simulated Annealing, Tabu search, Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Guided Local Search, Variable Neighborhood Search.
